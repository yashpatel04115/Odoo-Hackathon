## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- **XAMPP** (or any PHP + MySQL stack)
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher

### Step 1 — Clone or Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DyeStock.git
```

Or download the ZIP and extract it.

### Step 2 — Place in Web Root

Copy the `DyeStock` folder into your XAMPP `htdocs` directory:

```
C:\xampp\htdocs\DyeStock\
```

### Step 3 — Import the Database

1. Start **Apache** and **MySQL** in XAMPP Control Panel
2. Open **phpMyAdmin** → `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
3. Click **Import** → choose `database.sql` from the project folder
4. Click **Go**

### Step 4 — Configure Database Connection

Open `config/database.php` and update if needed:

```php
$host     = 'localhost';
$dbname   = 'dyestock';
$username = 'root';
$password = '';        // Leave blank for default XAMPP
```

### Step 5 — Open in Browser

```
http://localhost/DyeStock/

## 🔑 Default Login Credentials

| Role | Username | Password |
|------|----------|----------|
| Inventory Manager | `admin` | `admin` |

> ⚠️ Change the default password after first login for security.

To create a **Warehouse Staff** account, go to `register.php` and select the **Warehouse Staff** role.

---

## 📧 Email Configuration (OTP)

To enable OTP email for password reset, open `config/mail.php` and update:

```php
define('SMTP_FROM',      'your@gmail.com');
define('SMTP_FROM_NAME', 'DyeStock');
```

Then configure PHP's `mail()` in `php.ini` (for XAMPP):

```ini
[mail function]
SMTP=smtp.gmail.com
smtp_port=587
sendmail_from=your@gmail.com
```

> **Dev Mode:** If email is not configured, the OTP will be displayed directly on the screen so you can still test the flow without email setup.
